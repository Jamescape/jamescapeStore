# jamescapeStore
A basic PHP website which displays content from Cockpit headless CMS for a shopfront and redirects to another site for the actual product purchase.

Quite a specific use case but hopefully some of this will be useful for someone. I'm aware this is a very old and, now, unpopular way to build a site but it does the job well for this particular use case.

The live site is viewable at [store.jamescape.net](https://store.jamescape.net).

If you want some more information about the Cockpit set up, feel free to submit a [Service Request](https://jamesbarber.tech/help) and I'll see what I can do.
